[italic type]To all valued engineers:

I am pleased to announce that last week's small-scale tests of the Semper battery were a success. Although we are years away from using it to power submarines and military bases, I am confident these preliminary test results represent a step forward for this company.

A few of you have expressed concerns the full-sized prototype would set off a reaction that would result in, and I quote, 'a localized fiery explosion as well as a massive electromagnetic pulse that would have catastrophic effects on electronic devices in a 20-mile radius.' 

My brother Ted was opposed to further testing for this reason and unfortunately did not hide that fact from lower-level employees. However, we had an extensive conversation yesterday, and he is now as confident as I am that full testing will be a success and will be harmless to us and the surrounding area. 

To the naysayers among us, I say if a respected engineer like Ted can change his opinion, please consider re-evaluating yours.

The first full-scale test will take place at 11 a.m. Please join us in the 32nd floor breakroom at noon for a celebratory luncheon.
